      "markdownText": "\n## Number of functions\n\nSay we have a set Y of cardinal n. How many functions f can exist in Y?\n\nFirst let's look at **one** possible function of f : {1, 2, 3... r}  -> Y\n\n> From now on we'll refer to {1, 2, 3.. r} as **N<sub>r</sub>**\n\nLet's say N<sub>r</sub> = {1, 2, 3} and Y = {a, b}\n\nThen one possible function would be the binary relation f = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b)}\n\n> Reminder: this means f(1) = a, f(2) = a, f(3) = b\n\n> From now own we'll just write that as **aab** since it's shorter to write\n\nBut another one could be abc, or aaa or bab, or.. you get the idea. It's every possible combination of a, b up to 3 characters, that is, the **variation**. In a more general way all the possible functions would all the possible **n** combinations of **r** length/size\n\nIn order to calculate this variation(aka **every possible combination**) let's make use of a tree diagram:\n\nY = {a, b}\n\nN<sub>3</sub> = {1, 2, 3}\n\n\n![Tree](https://i.imgur.com/iCrazYP.png\n)\n\nAs you might see, for every column **r** from N<sub>r</sub> there's **n** choices from Y so first column is 2, then for every one of those two there's another two so 2·2, for every one of those 2·2 there's another two so 2·2·2\n\nSo the answer is 2<sup>3</sup>. In a more general form, all the possible combinations are:\n\n> VR(n, r) = n<sup>r</sup>\n\nAnd as we saw at the beginning. All the possible combinations are just all the possible f : N<sub>r</sub> -> Y that there can be so this result is all the possible functions in this case.\n\n---\n\n### Example 1\n\nHow many functions can we make of N<sub>7</sub> in Y = {0, 1}\n\n> nº of functions = VR(2, 7) = 2<sup>7</sup> = 128\n\n### Example 2\nIs there a set Y such that you can define 512 functions of N<sub>3</sub> in Y? And of N<sub>4</sub>?\n\nLet's imagine there is and it's cardinal is n, so:\n\n> nº of functions = VR(n, 3) = n<sup>3</sup> = 512\n\n> n = 512<sup>1/3</sup> = 8\n\nSo any set X of cardinal 8 will have this many functions of N<sub>3</sub>\n\nAs for N<sub>4</sub>:\n\n> n = 512<sup>1/4</sup> = 4.75\n\nIt's not a whole number so no. However 5 would contain more than that, but not 512 exactly.\n",

      "markdownText": "## Number of injective functions\n\n**Important: Please refer to Number of functions if you haven't read that part yet**\n\nSay we have a set Y of cardinal n. How many functions injective f can exist in Y(cardinal **n**)?\n\nAs we saw in the last chapter the number of functions of the form \n\n> f: N<sub>r</sub> -> Y\n\nIs nothing but the number of all possible **n combinations of length r**, which is **n<sup>r</sup>** (so the variation)\n\nHowever, in an injective function there can't be repeated counter images\n\n> Reminder: f = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, a)} would not be an injective function since f(1) = f(3)\n\nSo the answer is n combinations of length r **without repetition**. How do we find this out?\n\nLet's try to deduce the answer through an example. We have:\n\n> N<sub>3</sub>, Y = {a, b ,c}\n\nSimilar to in **Number of functions** we'll use the same tree diagram but with a very important difference:\n\n![tree](https://i.imgur.com/K6mj0X2.png)\n\nNow on every column instead of giving the choice of every element in Y we'll take out the one that has already been previously chosen \n\n---\n\n### Bijective functions\n\nIf n = r then it's a bijective function since it'll be both injective and have all of N<sub>r</sub> mapped. That means that it'll be surjective and since it's both injective and surjective that means it's bijective.\n\n---\n\n## Example 1\n\nHow many numbers below 100 with two different digits can you write using only 1, 3, 5 and 7?\n\nOur input space is {1, 3, 5 ,7}. With this set we can make numbers of two digits like\n\nf : {1,3,5,7} -> 54\n\nor\n\nf : {1,3,5,7} -> 13\n\nProblem is merely asking how many functions can exist like these other two. It also says digits don't repeat so it's asking how many injective functions there are, which, as we just saw earlier, is :\n\n> 4·3 = 12\n\n## Example 2\n\nIn a bookshell there's 6 different books. How many ways can we rearrange them?\n\nWe could either think of this similar to example 2 with a function that simply possibly changes the order of books like \n\nf : {a, b, c, d, e, f} = {b, a , e ,c , d ,f}\n\nSo number of possible functions is:\n\n> 6·5·4·3·2·1 = 720\n\nSince books can't repeat (problem doesn't specify they can magically be cloned)",
